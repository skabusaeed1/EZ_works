# EZ Works

## Overview

This project is a simple single-page web application built with React.js, designed to showcase how to create a responsive form that integrates with a RESTful API. The form allows users to submit an email address and performs both front-end and API validations.

### Features

- Responsive design for various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Front-end validation to ensure the email field is not empty and follows a valid email format.
- API integration using Axios for sending POST requests to the provided API endpoint.
- Handling API responses, including error messages and success messages.
- Demonstrates error handling for cases when the email ends with "@ez.works."

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the form and making it responsive.
